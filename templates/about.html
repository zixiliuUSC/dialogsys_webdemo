				<h4>What is <span class="demo-name">SpolinBot</span>?</h4>
				<p> 
					SpolinBot is a chat bot that models improvisational dialogue ("improv") between two actors; specifically, it attempts to provide "yes, and" responses to whatever you type. 
					
					It is built by fine-tuning a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DialoGPT" target="_blank">DialoGPT</a> model with <span id="dataset"> SPOLIN</span>, a corpus of "yes, and" dialogue pairs. 
					
					The model chooses among several options in a way that maximizes the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information" target="_blank">mutual information</a> they contain, but also presents other options so you can choose an alternative from the dropdown menu if you don't like the top choice.  
				</p>

				<h4>What is a "Yes, and"?</h4>

				<p>
					The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and..." target="_blank">yes-and principle</a> is a rule-of-thumb of improvisational theatre that suggests that a participant should accept the reality of what the other participant has said (“Yes”) and expand or refine that reality with additional information(“and”). It does not require the response to explicitly contain the phrase "Yes, and". Below are some examples:

					<div class="caption">
						Explicit (top) and implicit (bottom) examples of yes-ands in the <span id="dataset"> SPOLIN</span> corpus. The text underlined in green reflects acceptance of the context established in the prompt ("yes") and the text underlined in orange initiates a new relevant contribution to the dialogue ("and").

				<h4><span id="dataset"> SPOLIN</span> Corpus</h4>
				<p>
					We collected "yes, and" dialogue pairs from <a href="https://www.earwolf.com/show/spontaneanation-with-paul-f-tompkins/" target="_blank">Spontaneanation</a>, an improv podcast hosted by Paul F. Tompkins, and then mined more pairs from the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html" target="_blank">Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus </a> and the <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/pt/indicadores/Ficheiros/10062.pdf" target="_blank"> SubTle corpus</a>. Read our <a href="https://justin-cho.com/spolin">project page</a> and our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09544" target="_blank">paper</a> for more details. 
				</p>

				<h4> I didn't like any of the responses! </h4>
				<p>
					Sometimes SpolinBot doesn’t do a great job understanding what you meant or doesn’t carry the conversation forward particularly well. We’re sorry, and we’re hard at work trying to make the bot better at having improvisational conversations! In the meantime, you can select “retry” at the bottom of the response list to get a new set of responses or click the “restart” button at the top of the dialogue to start from scratch.
				</p>


				<h4 id="decoder"> What are those Decoder Settings all about? </h4>

				<p>
					You can play around with the “top k”, “temperature”, and “MMI temperature” slider bars to vary the "creativity" of the messages generated by the bot in different ways. In general, higher values will lead to more creativity, but here are a few details: For each decoding step, the model predicts a probability distribution for the next token. The value chosen for top k will be used so that only k tokens with the highest probabilities will be considered candidates for multinomial sampling. The value for temperature is used to divide the predicted logits before the softmax layer, smoothing or sharpening the distribution at  higher/lower temperatures. The value for Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) Temperature acts in a similar way, but for scoring the outputs in a reverse model (P(input|output)), used in calculating mutual information. You can read more about these parameters in detail in this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277"> Medium article</a> and more about the MMI criterion in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03055.pdf">Jiwei Li's paper</a>.
